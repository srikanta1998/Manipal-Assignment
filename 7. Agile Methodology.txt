Stages of Agile Methodology
---------------------------

There are six stages in the agile methodology they are :

1. Planning :

-> Here the scope of the project will be defined along with goals and objectives.The size of the sprint team will be decided.

2. Sprint :

-> The team lead by the scrum master will work on task or user stories for a time period of 1-4 weeks. At the end of each sprint, the team delivers a working product or feature.

3. Stand-up Meeting :

-> The team meets daily to discuss progress, issues, and plans for the day.

4. Review :

-> At the end of each sprint, the team reviews the progress made and the deliverables produced, and evaluates whether the goals and objectives have been met.

5. Retrospective :

-> The team holds a retrospective meeting to discuss what went well, what didn't go well, and how the team can improve in the next sprint.

6. Continuous Integration and Delivery : 

-> The team uses continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) practices to ensure that changes are integrated into the product quickly and efficiently, with automated testing and deployment processes.
